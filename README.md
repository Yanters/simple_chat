# Simple Chat Coding Challenge

## What is this?

- Simple Chat allows you to describe who you want to chat with, then start an AI chat with them

## What to do?

### Step 1: Make the app actually work

- the functionality of the app doesn't work!
- the basic ui is there so you don't have to make it from scratch, but feel free to change/upgrade the UI however you want. you can use any additional libraries or anything else you want if needed
- you can use whatever LLM you want. I reccocmend going on open router and picking one from there so you can easily test a bunch. Message me for an api key

### Step 2: Add a fun feature to the app

- there's a billion chat apps out there, add a fun feature that will set your chat app apart!

### Step 3: Write a short list of what else you would do if you had to make this a full feature

- Character image generation (using AI, when models allow)

- Memory & context for persistent character conversations

- Voice input/output with speech-to-text and text-to-speech

- Typing indicator before bot replies

- Multi-character chats or roleplay scenarios

- Custom themes for chat styling and vibe

- Export chat as PDF or image

## What am i looking for?

- can you quickly write high quality code
- do you know how to work with LLMs (or can you learn quickly)?
- how cool is your fun feature?

## Submission instructions

- fork the repo (eg. clone the repo and push it to your own version of on github)
- make me a contributor to the repo!
- send me an email with the repo once you're done, along with a short message about what your fun feature was and a short list of features you would add if you had more time
